                            Music helps me get in the groove when coding. It also helps when decompressing from a particularly difficult piece of code. My streaming site of choice: <a href ='https://open.spotify.com' target ='_blank'>Spotify</a>
                        </li>
                        <li> Planning out my time so I know when I have time to learn coding, or time to work on a project is really helpful. I like <a href='https://calendar.google.com/calendar' target ='_blank'> Google Calendar for this</a> </li>
