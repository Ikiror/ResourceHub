# About this project
I made this project to store resources and stuff that helps/helped me learrn to code.
Some of the stuff in this include:
* Learning Resources - sites that helped me learn coding and different languages
* Layout and Look Resources - sites that help me plot out how I want things organized
<!-- * Cheatsheets and Documentation - condensed and easy to access information on things I need to know to build my websites in regards to coding languages -->
* Extras - other random things that helped me code (e.g. some playlists and productivity things)
